### **Mission Walkthrough: Shanghaied**

The **Shanghaied** mission is one of the final Main Operations in *Watch Dogs 2*. It involves uncovering a smuggling operation tied to Blume and Chinese hackers, infiltrating a barge, and retrieving critical data. This mission combines stealth, hacking puzzles, and combat, requiring strategic planning and patience.

#### **Objective**
Investigate a smuggling operation, hack into a barge, and retrieve Blume’s server tower to expose their illegal activities.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet Josh at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Begin the mission by heading to the DedSec hackerspace and speaking with Josh.
- A cutscene will play where DedSec learns about suspicious activity involving the Auntie Shu Boys gang and their connection to Blume.

#### **2. Investigate the Shipping Container**
- **Travel to the Docks:** Follow your waypoint to the docks where a suspicious shipping container is located.
- **Use the Crane:**
  - Take control of the dock crane and move a shipping container blocking access to the one you need.
  - Drop the container a few feet away (the exact location doesn’t matter).
- **Open the Container:**
  - Interact with the container to trigger a cutscene revealing its contents.
- **Escape the Area:**
  - Guards will be alerted after the cutscene. Flee from the area using stealth or combat as needed.

#### **3. Find Documents in the Safe**
- **Meet an Informant:** Travel to a new location to meet with an informant who provides intel on a gang hideout containing important documents.
- **Infiltrate the Gang Hideout:**
  - Scout the area using *NetHack* mode or drones to mark guards and hackable objects.
  - Three enemies patrol outside:
    - Use distractions like hacking phones or triggering environmental traps to take them out quietly.
    - Perform silenced takedowns on isolated guards.
  - Once outside guards are neutralized, enter the building.
- **Deal with Indoor Guards:**
  - Guards inside are in close proximity, making stealth more challenging.
  - Use abilities like *Mass Communication Disruption* to disable enemy communications temporarily.
  - Alternatively, create noise downstairs (e.g., with an explosion) to lure guards away from key areas.
- **Retrieve Documents:**
  - Hack into or open the safe containing documents about Blume’s smuggling operation.
- **Escape:**
  - Exit the hideout while avoiding reinforcements.

#### **4. Hack Into The Barge**
- **Travel to a Lighthouse:** Drive to a lighthouse near your next objective.
- **Climb Up:**
  - Climb to the top of the lighthouse and activate a terminal to begin hacking into satellites.
- **Satellite Hacking Mini-Game:**
  - Jump between satellites until you locate the barge.
  - Hack into cameras on board the barge:
    - Use *NetHack* mode to find Access Keys held by guards or stored on devices.
    - Once you have an Access Key, locate a golden terminal that is your objective.  
    - This terminal is monitored by a moving camera attached to a guard’s belt. Wait for them to walk into range before hacking it.

#### **5. Control a Drone Inside The Barge**
- After completing initial hacks:
  - Gain control of a small drone inside the barge.
  - Navigate through tight spaces using stacked objects as ramps or paths.
  - Hack into another computer at the end of this path.

#### **6. Steal The Main Server Tower**
- **Travel to Another Dock:** Drive to a dock where you’ll meet an informant who provides access to a boat leading you to the barge.
- **Board The Barge:**
  - Use stealth or combat as you approach and climb aboard:
    - Stealth: Most enemies are spread out, making it easier to sneak past them while using distractions for isolated takedowns.
    - Combat: If you prefer going loud, bring powerful weapons as some enemies have body armor.
    - Tag all enemies using *NetHack* mode for better awareness of their movements.

- **Hack Into The Server:**
  - Make your way to the top of the barge and interact with a server console.

#### **7. Extract The Server Tower**
- After hacking into the server:
  - Descend several levels of the barge until you find a forklift.
  - Control the forklift and drive it onto a platform elevator.
  - Activate the elevator console to lift both yourself and the server tower up several levels.
- Once at the top:
  - Interact with another console for extraction, triggering a cutscene that concludes this part of the mission.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Drones Effectively:** Both Jumper and Quadcopter drones are invaluable for scouting restricted areas and hacking terminals remotely without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones so you can track enemy movements and locate hackable objects like cameras or traps.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Botnet Upgrade* (to improve hacking efficiency) can make this mission significantly easier.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Blume’s smuggling operation and illegal activities.
- Progress further in DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Shanghaied" mission combines stealth, hacking puzzles, drone navigation, and combat in one of *Watch Dogs 2*’s most intricate operations, making it both challenging and rewarding!
