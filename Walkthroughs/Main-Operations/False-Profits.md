### **Mission Walkthrough: False Profits**

The **False Profits** mission is a key Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2*. In this mission, DedSec targets the New Dawn religious organization, which is exploiting its followers for profit. Marcus must infiltrate their headquarters, gather incriminating evidence, and expose their fraudulent practices to the public.

#### **Objective**
Expose the New Dawn religious organization by hacking into their systems and retrieving evidence of their corruption.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** After completing "CyberDriver," head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene.
- The team discusses how New Dawn is manipulating its followers and decides to take action against the organization.

#### **2. Travel to New Dawn's Temple**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the New Dawn Temple in Oakland.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the temple is a restricted area with guards patrolling.

#### **3. Infiltrate the New Dawn Temple**
- **Scout the Area:**  
  - Use *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects.
  - If you have the Jumper drone or Quadcopter unlocked, use them to explore the area remotely and locate objectives.

- **Enter the Temple Grounds:**  
  - Approach from the side entrances or climb over fences to avoid heavily guarded areas.
  - Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to create openings.

#### **4. Hack the First Terminal**
- Your first objective is to hack into a terminal inside one of the temple buildings.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to locate an access key held by a guard or stored on a laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, enter the building and interact with the terminal to download data about New Dawn’s finances.

#### **5. Hack the Second Terminal**
- After completing the first hack, head toward a second terminal located in another part of the temple.
- Expect more guards in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like hiding behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.
- Interact with the second terminal to retrieve more incriminating data.

#### **6. Escape the Temple**
- With both terminals hacked, you’ll need to leave the area:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., exploding pipes or triggering electrical panels) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a quick escape.

#### **7. Investigate New Dawn's Headquarters**
- After escaping the temple, follow your waypoint to New Dawn’s main headquarters in San Francisco.
- This building is also a restricted area with tight security.

#### **8. Infiltrate New Dawn's Headquarters**
- **Scout Thoroughly:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or drones to mark guards and locate objectives inside the building.
  - Look for an open window or side entrance for easier access.

- **Hack into Their Servers:**  
  - Your goal is to reach a server room on an upper floor of the building.
  - Use cameras and distractions to bypass guards or disable security systems along your path.
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by aligning energy nodes in NetHack mode to unlock access to the server room.

#### **9. Retrieve Evidence**
- Once inside the server room, interact with a computer terminal to download evidence of New Dawn’s fraudulent activities.
- A cutscene will play showing Marcus uncovering damning information about how New Dawn exploits its followers financially.

#### **10. Escape New Dawn's Headquarters**
- After retrieving the evidence, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth or combat tactics based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through a side door or climb out of windows for a faster escape.

#### **11. Expose New Dawn**
- With all evidence collected, head back to DedSec HQ or follow your waypoint to a public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about New Dawn onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing New Dawn’s corruption and gaining significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing New Dawn’s corruption.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
