### **Mission Walkthrough: Power to the Sheeple**

The **Power to the Sheeple** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec takes on Congressman Thruss, a corrupt politician manipulating public opinion through technology. This mission involves multiple objectives, including graffiti vandalism, infiltrating !NViTE, and destroying rigged voting machines.

#### **Objective**
Expose Congressman Thruss’s corruption by hacking into his systems, sabotaging his campaign, and destroying rigged voting machines.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Graffiti Thruss’s Billboard**
- **Starting Point:** Begin the mission by heading to the DedSec hackerspace and speaking with Sitara. She assigns you the task of defacing one of Congressman Thruss’s billboards.
- **Travel to the Billboard:** Drive to the marked location on your map.
- **Climb to the Billboard:**
  - Use the crane nearby to reach the roof of the building where the billboard is located.
  - Swing the crane platform into position, lower it, and climb aboard. Raise yourself to the roof.
  - If you have the *Super Jump* upgrade for your Jumper drone, you can bypass some obstacles by jumping over fences.
  - Alternatively, sneak your Jumper drone across a small ledge to activate a red panel that unlocks access to the billboard.
- **Tag the Billboard:** Once on top, interact with the billboard to graffiti it with DedSec’s message.

#### **2. Infiltrate !NViTE**
- After tagging the billboard, meet Sitara at a new location. A cutscene will play where she explains that Thruss is using !NViTE’s algorithms to manipulate voters.
- **Travel to !NViTE Headquarters:** Drive to the marked location.
- **Scout the Building:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode or deploy your Jumper drone to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects inside.
  - There are only a few guards here, spread out enough that you can take them down one at a time without much trouble.
- **Hack Objectives:**
  - **First Objective:** Head upstairs and hack a computer on the second floor. This will allow you to remotely hack a laptop in another room using your camera view.
  - **Second Objective:** Go downstairs and find a locked door leading to the basement. Follow red lines in NetHack mode back to a panel that unlocks it. Enter and interact with another computer terminal to trigger a hacking mini-game.
    - The puzzle is straightforward with no time limits or random rotations. Solve it from both rooms connected via cables.

- **Escape !NViTE:** With both objectives complete and guards cleared out earlier, simply walk out of the building.

#### **3. Reach Thruss’s Penthouse**
- After leaving !NViTE, meet Wrench at another location for a cutscene. He’ll join you for this next objective.
- **Travel to Thruss’s Penthouse:**
  - Drive Wrench to the marked location.
  - Enter an alley near the building and start climbing toward your objective.
- **Use Crane Platform:**
  - Hack into a crane platform near a ctOS box and swing it across to access Thruss’s penthouse rooftop.
  - Drop yourself onto an adjacent building's roof using this crane.

#### **4. Download Evidence from Thruss’s Penthouse**
- Once on top of Thruss’s penthouse:
  - The area is crawling with guards. Start by thinning their numbers from above:
    - Use environmental hacks like exploding objects or distractions to take out guards silently or lure them into traps.
    - Snipe enemies from cover or use stealth takedowns if they approach your position.
  - Clear out all guards on this level before proceeding downstairs.

- **Hack Objectives:**
  - Interact with a computer terminal inside the penthouse to begin downloading incriminating evidence against Thruss. The download takes time but should be safe if all guards are eliminated beforehand.

- **Escape via Zipline:**
  - Once the download is complete, head toward an objective marker at the corner of the building and use a zipline to escape safely.

#### **5. Destroy Rigged Voting Machines**
- After escaping Thruss’s penthouse, meet Josh at another location for a cutscene where he explains that voting machines have been rigged in favor of Thruss.
- **Travel to Warehouse:**
  - Drive to a warehouse filled with heavily armed guards protecting these machines.
- **Scout and Plan Your Approach:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode or drones to mark guards and locate environmental objects like explosive barrels or hackable devices.
  - You can choose between stealthy infiltration or direct combat:
    - Stealth: Take down isolated guards one at a time using distractions or melee attacks.
    - Aggressive: Use explosives or environmental traps for crowd control.

- **Destroy Voting Machines:**
  - Locate four clusters of voting machines inside the warehouse and destroy them:
    - Use explosives (crafted devices or environmental hazards) or weapons capable of dealing significant damage.
    - Clear out guards before focusing on objectives for an easier time.

#### **6. Escape and Complete Mission**
- Once all voting machines are destroyed:
  - Exit the warehouse while avoiding reinforcements if they arrive during your escape.
  - A cutscene will play showing DedSec successfully exposing Thruss’s corruption and sabotaging his campaign.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Environmental Hacks:** Exploding objects or triggering distractions can help thin out enemies without direct combat.
2. **Upgrade Your Tools:** Abilities like *Explosive Device Hack* (to detonate grenades carried by guards) can make combat sections easier.
3. **Plan Your Escape Routes:** Before engaging enemies or objectives, scout for exits in case reinforcements arrive during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Congressman Thruss’s corruption and sabotaging his campaign.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Power to the Sheeple" mission combines stealth, hacking puzzles, environmental strategy, and combat in one of *Watch Dogs 2*’s most politically charged operations!
