### **Mission Walkthrough: Wipe Your Profile**

The opening mission of *Watch Dogs 2*, **Wipe Your Profile**, serves as a tutorial that introduces players to the core mechanics of the game, including movement, stealth, hacking, and combat. Below is a detailed guide to help you successfully complete the mission.

#### **Objective**
Erase Marcus Holloway's personal ctOS profile from Blume's server farm.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Infiltrate the Server Farm**
- **Starting Point:** The mission begins with Marcus being dropped behind the fences of Blume's server farm.  
- **Climb the Ladder:** Follow the waypoint and climb up the ladder on your right.  
- **Take Out the First Guard:** After a cutscene, approach the guard silently and perform a melee takedown. This introduces you to stealth mechanics.

#### **2. Enter the Parking Lot**
- **Hop Down:** Jump into the parking lot on your left.  
- **Neutralize Guards:** Use your stun gun or melee attacks to take out two patrolling guards.  
  - *Tip:* Use cover to avoid being spotted and take them out one at a time.  
- **Collect Money Bag:** Look for a money bag in the shipping containers near the staircase and pick it up.

#### **3. Hack Your Way Inside**
- **Head Upstairs:** Climb the stairs and follow on-screen instructions to perform your first physical hack at a terminal.  
- **Unlock the Door:** Move through the door to trigger another cutscene.
- **Use NetHack Mode:** Activate *NetHack* (detective vision) to locate a nearby camera. Hack into it, then jump between cameras until you find one that allows you to hack a laptop for a door access key.  
  - *Tip:* Use this opportunity to tag guards and familiarize yourself with your surroundings.

#### **4. Reach the Server Tower**
- **Open the Door:** With the passcode acquired, unlock the door and proceed inside.  
- **Climb Higher Floors:** Use cover mechanics to avoid guards as you ascend through multiple floors of the server farm.
  - *Tip:* Tag all guards using cameras or NetHack mode to track their movements.
- **Hack the Server:** Once you reach the server tower, initiate a hack by interacting with it. Stay hidden until the progress bar completes.

#### **5. Solve the Puzzle**
- After completing the first hack, climb up another level using ladders until you reach a locked computer room.
- **Redirect Energy Nodes:** Use NetHack mode to trace red lines leading to energy nodes. Rotate these nodes until all connections are active, unlocking access to the computer.
- Interact with the computer to delete Marcus’s profile and select a new online appearance (purely cosmetic).

#### **6. Escape the Facility**
- After erasing your profile, guards will be on high alert.
  - *Option 1: Stealthy Exit:* Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - *Option 2: Aggressive Exit:* Use your stun gun or environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels) to incapacitate guards.
- Head down through barriers and doors until you reach an exit point.
- A cutscene will trigger as Marcus escapes successfully.

#### **7. Visit DedSec Hackerspace**
- After escaping, follow your map marker to DedSec’s hideout beneath a game store in San Francisco.
  - *Fast Travel Tip:* You can fast travel to nearby locations if you don’t want to drive.
- Inside DedSec HQ:
  - Talk to team members to unlock new tools like:
    - The Jumper (RC car for tight spaces).
    - The Research App (for skill upgrades).
    - A 3D printed pistol (optional weapon).
  - Download all available apps from Marcus’s phone store for an achievement/trophy.

### **Tips for Success**

2. **Tag Guards Early:** Always tag enemies before entering restricted areas for better situational awareness.
3. **Experiment with Hacking Tools:** Practice using distractions like hacking phones or triggering environmental traps.
