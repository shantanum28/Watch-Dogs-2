### **Mission Walkthrough: Limp Nudle**

The **Limp Nudle** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec targets Nudle, a tech giant (parodying Google), to uncover and expose their secret AI project. This mission involves infiltrating the Nudle campus, hacking into their systems, and retrieving sensitive data about their unethical practices.

#### **Objective**
Infiltrate Nudle’s campus, hack into their systems, and expose their secretive AI project.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team discusses Nudle’s dominance in the tech industry and its secretive AI project.
- DedSec decides to investigate and expose Nudle’s unethical practices.

#### **2. Travel to the Nudle Campus**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the Nudle campus in Silicon Valley.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the campus is a restricted area with security guards patrolling.

#### **3. Scout the Campus**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **4. Infiltrate the Campus**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **5. Hack into Nudle’s Systems**
- Your first objective is to hack into a terminal inside one of the buildings on campus.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **6. Investigate Nudle’s AI Project**
- After completing the first hack, follow your waypoint to another building on campus where Nudle’s AI research is stored.
- Expect tighter security in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.

- Inside the building:
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes in NetHack mode until all connections are active.
  - Interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about Nudle’s AI project.

#### **7. Escape the Campus**
- With both objectives completed, you’ll need to leave the campus:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels or exploding pipes) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side doors or climb over fences for a quick escape.

#### **8. Expose Nudle**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Nudle onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Nudle’s unethical practices and gaining significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Nudle’s unethical practices.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
