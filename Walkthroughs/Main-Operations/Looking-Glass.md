### **Mission Walkthrough: Looking Glass**

The **Looking Glass** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec investigates !NViTE, a social media company that is manipulating public opinion and collaborating with Blume. Marcus must infiltrate their facilities, uncover their ties to ctOS, and expose their unethical practices.

#### **Objective**
Expose !NViTE’s manipulation of public opinion and its partnership with Blume by hacking into their systems and retrieving incriminating data.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team discusses how !NViTE influences elections and public opinion using data collected from ctOS.
- DedSec decides to investigate and expose the company’s unethical practices.

#### **2. Travel to the !NViTE Office**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the !NViTE office in San Francisco.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the building is a restricted area with security guards patrolling.

#### **3. Infiltrate the !NViTE Office**
- **Scout the Area:**  
  - Use *NetHack* mode or your Jumper drone to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in their security systems, such as hackable junction boxes or cameras that provide access to locked areas.

- **Enter the Building:**  
  - Approach from a less guarded side of the building. Climb over fences or use environmental objects like forklifts to create pathways.
  - If you have the *Distraction Hack* skill unlocked, use it to distract guards by hacking their phones or triggering nearby devices.

#### **4. Hack into !NViTE’s Systems**
- Your first objective is to hack into a terminal on the ground floor of the building.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to locate an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **5. Hack into the CEO’s Office**
- After completing the first hack, head upstairs toward the CEO’s office.
- Expect more guards in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.
  
- Inside the CEO’s office:
  - Interact with another terminal to download incriminating emails and documents that reveal !NViTE’s manipulation tactics.

#### **6. Escape the !NViTE Office**
- With both objectives completed, you’ll need to leave the building:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels or exploding pipes) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side doors or climb out of windows for a quick escape.

#### **7. Investigate !NViTE’s Server Farm**
- After escaping the office, follow your waypoint to !NViTE’s server farm located outside San Francisco.
- This facility is heavily guarded and requires careful planning.

#### **8. Infiltrate the Server Farm**
- **Scout Thoroughly:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or drones to mark guards and locate objectives inside the server farm.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in their security systems, such as hackable cameras or junction boxes that can disable alarms.

- **Enter the Facility:**  
  - Approach from an unguarded side entrance or climb over fences using environmental objects like crates or forklifts.
  - Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering alarms to create openings.

#### **9. Hack into !NViTE’s Servers**
- Your objective is located inside a locked server room:
  - Use NetHack mode to trace red lines leading to junction boxes that control access. Hack these boxes remotely or physically interact with them if necessary.
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes until all connections are active.
  
- Once inside, interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about !NViTE’s collaboration with Blume.

#### **10. Escape the Server Farm**
- After completing the hack, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth tactics or combat skills based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a faster escape.

#### **11. Expose !NViTE**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about !NViTE onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing !NViTE’s manipulation of public opinion and its partnership with Blume.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing !NViTE’s unethical practices.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
