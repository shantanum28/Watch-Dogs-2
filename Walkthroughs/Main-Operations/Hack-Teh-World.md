### **Mission Walkthrough: Hack Teh World**

The **Hack Teh World** mission is the climactic finale of *Watch Dogs 2*. In this Main Operation, DedSec launches an all-out assault on Blume to dismantle their global ctOS infrastructure and expose their mass surveillance program. This mission involves infiltrating Blume’s heavily fortified headquarters, hacking into their systems, and delivering a final blow to their operations.

#### **Objective**
Infiltrate Blume’s headquarters, hack into their core servers, and expose the truth about ctOS to the world.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team discusses their final plan to take down Blume by exposing the full extent of their illegal surveillance and data manipulation.
- DedSec decides to directly target Blume’s headquarters and dismantle their global ctOS infrastructure.

#### **2. Travel to Blume’s Headquarters**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to Blume’s headquarters in Silicon Valley.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the facility is a heavily guarded restricted area with advanced security measures.

#### **3. Scout the Area**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, drones, and hackable objects in the area.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **4. Infiltrate Blume’s Headquarters**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **5. Hack into Blume’s Systems**
- Your first objective is to hack into a terminal inside Blume’s headquarters.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **6. Reach the Core Server Room**
- After completing the first hack, follow your waypoint deeper into Blume’s headquarters toward their core server room.
- Expect tighter security in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.

#### **7. Solve the Hacking Puzzle**
- Inside the core server room:
  - You’ll need to solve a complex hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes in NetHack mode until all connections are active.
  - Follow red lines leading from junction boxes to guide you through the puzzle.

#### **8. Hack into Blume’s Core Servers**
- Once inside the server room:
  - Interact with a computer terminal to initiate a massive data breach.
  - A cutscene will play showing DedSec downloading incriminating data about Blume’s global surveillance program.

#### **9. Escape Blume’s Headquarters**
- With the hack complete, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth tactics or combat skills based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a faster escape.

#### **10. Expose Blume Globally**
- After escaping Blume’s headquarters, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Blume onto social media platforms.
- A final cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Blume’s illegal activities and dismantling ctOS on a global scale. The public rallies behind DedSec as they deliver their ultimate victory against corporate surveillance.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Blume’s unethical practices and dismantling ctOS globally.
- Complete the Main Operations storyline of *Watch Dogs 2*.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for any remaining skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Hack Teh World" mission serves as an epic conclusion to DedSec’s fight against corporate surveillance, giving players an exciting mix of stealth, hacking puzzles, and high-stakes infiltration!
