### **Mission Walkthrough: Haum Sweet Haum**

The **Haum Sweet Haum** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec takes on Haum, a smart home company that is secretly spying on its customers. Marcus must infiltrate their offices, hack into their systems, and expose their unethical practices to the public.

#### **Objective**
Hack into Haum's servers and retrieve evidence of their invasive surveillance practices.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team discusses Haum’s smart home devices, which are collecting private data from unsuspecting users.
- DedSec decides to hack into Haum’s systems to expose their illegal surveillance.

#### **2. Travel to Haum’s Regional Office**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to Haum’s regional office in San Francisco.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the building is a restricted area with security guards patrolling.

#### **3. Infiltrate Haum’s Office**
- **Scout the Area:**  
  - Use *NetHack* mode or your Jumper drone to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects.
  - Look for an open window or side entrance for easier access.

- **Enter the Building:**  
  - Approach from a less guarded side of the building. Climb over fences or use environmental objects like forklifts to create pathways.
  - If you have the *Distraction Hack* skill unlocked, use it to distract guards by hacking their phones or triggering nearby devices.

#### **4. Hack the First Terminal**
- Inside the building, locate the first objective: a computer terminal on the ground floor.
- Use cameras or NetHack mode to identify an access key needed to unlock doors. The key is usually held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop.
- Once you have the key, unlock the door and interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **5. Hack the Second Terminal**
- After completing the first hack, head upstairs to find another terminal.
- Expect more guards in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.
- Interact with the second terminal to download more incriminating data about Haum’s surveillance practices.

#### **6. Escape Haum’s Office**
- With both terminals hacked, you’ll need to leave the building:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels or exploding pipes) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side doors or climb out of windows for a quick escape.

#### **7. Travel to Haum Data Center**
- After escaping Haum’s regional office, follow your waypoint to their data center located outside San Francisco.
- This facility is heavily guarded and requires careful planning.

#### **8. Infiltrate the Data Center**
- **Scout Thoroughly:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or drones to mark guards and locate objectives inside the data center.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in their security systems, such as hackable cameras or junction boxes that can disable alarms.

- **Enter the Facility:**  
  - Approach from an unguarded side entrance or climb over fences using environmental objects like crates or forklifts.
  - Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering alarms to create openings.

#### **9. Hack into Haum’s Servers**
- Your objective is located inside a locked server room:
  - Use NetHack mode to trace red lines leading to junction boxes that control access. Hack these boxes remotely or physically interact with them if necessary.
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes until all connections are active.
- Once inside, interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about Haum’s illegal activities.

#### **10. Escape the Data Center**
- After completing the hack, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth tactics or combat skills based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a faster escape.

#### **11. Expose Haum**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Haum onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Haum’s invasive surveillance practices and gaining significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Haum’s unethical practices.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
