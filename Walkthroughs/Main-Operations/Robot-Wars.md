### **Mission Walkthrough: Robot Wars**

The **Robot Wars** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec collaborates with Wrench to infiltrate Tidis Corporation, uncover their military robotics program, and expose their unethical practices. This mission involves stealth, hacking, and controlling a giant spider robot for some explosive fun.

#### **Objective**
Retrieve EMP parts, infiltrate Tidis Corporation, uncover their robotic prototypes, and expose their plans to weaponize robots for domestic and military use.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet Wrench at His Garage**
- **Starting Point:** Begin the mission by heading to Wrench’s garage. A cutscene will play where Wrench introduces his plan to use a robot (nicknamed "Wrench Jr.") as a Trojan horse to infiltrate Tidis Corporation.
- After the cutscene, drive to the Tidis repair depot to collect EMP parts.

#### **2. Collect EMP Parts at the Tidis Repair Depot**
- **Travel to the Depot:** Follow your waypoint to the repair depot.
- **Scout the Area:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode or drones to mark guards, hackable objects, and robots in the area.
  - Note that robots patrol alongside guards but are not aggressive unless they spot you or bump into a dead body.
- **Infiltrate the Depot:**
  - Avoid entering through the front door. Instead, head to the far-right side of the compound and climb a ladder onto the roof for a safer entry point.
  - From the roof, scope out the area below and plan your approach.
- **Hack Access Keys:**
  - Locate an access key using *NetHack* mode. Use your aerial drone to fly inside through a vent and hack the key from a computer terminal.
- **Collect EMP Parts:**
  - Once inside, navigate through the building and collect EMP components scattered across different locations. Guards are sparse inside, so take them out quietly or avoid them altogether.
  - Follow behind patrolling robots to stay hidden while collecting parts.

#### **3. Let Wrench Into the Compound**
- After collecting all EMP parts:
  - Head to a backdoor in the lobby area of the depot.
  - Sneak past a robot receptionist and activate a computer terminal to unlock the door for Wrench.
  - A cutscene will play where Wrench drops off "Wrench Jr." for the next phase of the mission.

#### **4. Plant EMP on Wrench Jr.**
- Approach Wrench Jr., interact with it, and plant the EMP device.
- Open the large shutter doors and leave the depot to complete this part of the mission.

#### **5. Infiltrate Tidis Corporation**
- After leaving the depot, drive into the hills toward Tidis Corporation’s main facility.
- A cutscene will trigger upon arrival, and you’ll take control of Wrench Jr.

#### **6. Control Wrench Jr. Inside Tidis**
- **Navigate Through Tidis:**
  - Use Wrench Jr.’s robotic controls to navigate through Tidis’s facility. Robots cannot use stairs, so you’ll need to follow ramps and paths marked with yellow gates.
  - Hack panels along your path by tracing white lines in *NetHack* mode back to control boxes. Activate these boxes to open gates or disable barriers.
- **Reach Key Locations:**
  - At certain points, you’ll encounter obstacles like foot-high railings or locked doors:
    - Hack nearby panels or boxes to bypass these obstacles.
    - Use ramps or elevators when necessary.

#### **7. Detonate EMP**
- Once you’ve reached your destination with Wrench Jr., detonate the EMP device to disable security systems in Tidis’s facility.

#### **8. Enter Tidis Building as Marcus**
- With security systems down, switch back to Marcus and enter Tidis Corporation through its front entrance.
- Navigate through staircases and guarded areas while avoiding motion-sensing cameras:
  - Distract guards or use stealth takedowns as you proceed toward your objectives.

#### **9. Download Project Files**
- Head toward Tidis’s Technology Wing:
  - Take out guards patrolling this area one by one using distractions or melee attacks.
  - Hack into computers in designated rooms to retrieve project files detailing Tidis’s plans for weaponized robots.

#### **10. Explore Prototype Labs**
- After retrieving project files, head toward Tidis’s prototype labs on a lower level.
- Solve a hacking mini-game at three consoles near a large iron door:
  - Rotate energy nodes until all connections are active to unlock access to the lab.

#### **11. Control Giant Spider Robot**
- Once inside the prototype lab:
  - Take control of a massive spider robot using a nearby command console.
  - Destroy targets on ceilings or walls by climbing surfaces for better angles.
  - Follow objective markers while wreaking havoc on guards and equipment throughout Tidis’s facility.

#### **12. Escape Tidis Facility**
- After completing your objectives with the spider robot:
  - Return control to Marcus and exit through an elevator leading back up.
  - Avoid reinforcements as you make your way out of Tidis Corporation.

#### **13. Expose Tidis’s Plans**
- With all data collected:
  - Upload evidence of Tidis’s weaponized robotics program onto DedSec’s social media platforms.
  - A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing how Blume and Tidis plan to use robots against civilians.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Drones Effectively:** The aerial drone is particularly useful for scouting areas with heavy guard presence or hacking terminals remotely.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements and locate hackable objects.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) or *Botnet Upgrade* (to improve hacking efficiency) are helpful during this mission.

### **Rewards**
- Gain +464,000 followers for DedSec by exposing Tidis’s unethical practices.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Robot Wars" mission is one of *Watch Dogs 2*’s most action-packed operations, combining stealth with high-tech chaos as you take down one of Blume’s most dangerous collaborators!
