### **Mission Walkthrough: CyberDriver**

The **CyberDriver** mission is one of the first major Main Operations in *Watch Dogs 2*. In this mission, DedSec plans to use a high-tech car from a cheesy action movie to promote their cause and gain more followers. The mission involves infiltrating a studio, stealing the CyberDriver car, and escaping in an epic police chase.

#### **Objective**
Steal the CyberDriver car from HMP Studios and use it to create a viral stunt for DedSec.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Watch the CyberDriver Trailer**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace after completing "Wipe Your Profile."
- Interact with the team to watch a hilariously bad trailer for *CyberDriver*, a fictional action movie.
- After the cutscene, Marcus and the team decide to steal the car used in the movie to expose HMP Studios' hypocrisy and gain followers.

#### **2. Travel to HMP Studios**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to HMP Studios.
- Use any vehicle or fast travel to reach the location.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the studio is a restricted area with guards patrolling.

#### **3. Infiltrate HMP Studios**
- **Scout the Area:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to highlight guards, cameras, and hackable objects.  
  - Use your Jumper drone (if unlocked) or hack into cameras to mark enemies and locate objectives.  

- **Enter the Studio:**  
  - Approach from the south side of the studio where vending machines and scaffolding are located.  
  - Climb onto vending machines and scaffolding to bypass guards at ground level.  

- **Optional Approach:**  
  - If you prefer stealth, use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or forklifts).  
  - For a more aggressive approach, use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards in your path.

#### **4. Steal Movie Script Data**
- Once inside, head toward the first objective: a computer terminal containing movie script data.
- **Hack into Cameras:** Use cameras to locate an access key required for locked doors. The key is usually on a guard’s phone or nearby laptop.
- After obtaining the key, unlock the door leading to the computer terminal.
- Interact with the terminal to download data about *CyberDriver*.

#### **5. Escape HMP Studios**
- With the data downloaded, you need to leave the studio:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - Alternatively, create distractions or hack objects like doors and forklifts to slow down pursuers if you're spotted.
- Once outside, head toward Marcus’s next objective marker.

#### **6. Locate and Steal the CyberDriver Car**
- After escaping HMP Studios, meet with an informant on a rooftop nearby.
  - Climb up using skids or other objects to reach him.
  - He provides information on where HMP Studios is storing the CyberDriver car.

- Follow your waypoint to another restricted area where guards are patrolling near a truck containing the car.
  - Use stealth or distractions to approach undetected.
  - Hack into cameras or use your Jumper drone (if available) to scout out guard positions and disable alarms.

- Once you reach the truck, interact with it to trigger a cutscene where Marcus takes control of the CyberDriver car.

#### **7. Escape with the CyberDriver Car**
- After stealing the car, you’ll immediately trigger a police chase:
  - Drive through San Francisco’s streets while avoiding police vehicles and helicopters.
  - Use hacking abilities like:
    - Disabling traffic lights at intersections to cause accidents behind you.
    - Triggering roadblocks or steam pipes along your escape route.

- Follow waypoints that guide you through cinematic stunts like jumps and tight turns. This segment is designed as an exciting chase scene showcasing both Marcus’s hacking skills and DedSec’s creativity.

#### **8. Deliver the Car**
- After losing police attention, drive toward Wrench’s garage as marked on your map.
- A cutscene will play once you arrive safely at DedSec HQ, concluding this part of the mission.

#### **9. Perform Stunts for DedSec Promotion (Optional)**
- As part of DedSec’s plan, Marcus uses the CyberDriver car for promotional stunts around San Francisco:
  - Follow designated paths while performing tricks like high-speed jumps or weaving through obstacles.
  - Avoid crashing into buildings or losing control of the vehicle during these sequences.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Distractions:** Hacking phones or triggering environmental objects can make sneaking into restricted areas much easier.
2. **Scout Thoroughly:** Always mark enemies and hackable devices before entering restricted zones using NetHack mode or drones.
3. **Upgrade Vehicle Hacking:** If possible, unlock abilities like *Vehicle Directional Hack* (to move enemy cars) or *Disable Helicopters* for smoother escapes during police chases.
4. **Stay Calm During Chases:** Use alleys, tunnels, or hiding spots (e.g., underpasses) when trying to evade pursuers.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by completing this high-profile stunt.
- Unlock new missions in DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Open up opportunities for vehicle-related upgrades in Marcus’s skill tree.

The "CyberDriver" mission is an early highlight in *Watch Dogs 2*, combining stealth gameplay with cinematic action sequences that showcase Marcus's hacking skills and DedSec's flair for showmanship!
