### **Mission Walkthrough: Motherload**

The **Motherload** mission is the final Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2*. In this climactic mission, DedSec takes on Blume and its CTO, Dušan Nemec, to expose their corruption and dismantle their control over ctOS. This mission involves multiple characters, hacking puzzles, combat, and infiltration, culminating in a satisfying conclusion to the game.

#### **Objective**
Take down Blume by hacking their systems, exposing Dušan Nemec’s crimes, and delivering the final blow to ctOS.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Begin the mission by heading to the DedSec hackerspace. A cutscene will play where the team decides it’s time to take down Blume once and for all.
- Marcus assigns tasks to each team member, and you’ll play as multiple characters during this mission.

#### **2. Sitara’s Section**
- **Objective:** Solve a hacking puzzle to gain access to Blume’s systems.
- **Travel to the Objective:** You’ll take control of Sitara. Run toward the waypoint, climbing and diving over obstacles along the way.
- **Solve the Hacking Puzzle:**
  - Once you reach the objective, you’ll encounter a hacking puzzle with a 90-second time limit.
  - Since Sitara doesn’t have a drone, you’ll need to jump around manually to locate nodes and align them correctly.
  - Complete the puzzle to unlock access to Blume’s systems.

#### **3. Wrench’s Section**
- **Objective:** Cause chaos inside Blume’s facility.
- **Combat Focus:** Wrench is heavily armed, so this section encourages an aggressive approach.
  - While stealth can help you get into position initially, an alarm will trigger regardless of your actions.
  - Use Wrench’s arsenal of weapons and explosives to fight your way through enemies.
- **Blow Up Servers:**
  - After reaching your objective, plant explosives on four large servers located inside walls.
  - Once all servers are destroyed, escape the building while fighting off reinforcements.

#### **4. Marcus’s Infiltration**
- **Objective:** Hack into Blume’s core systems and expose Dušan Nemec.
- **Enter Blume Headquarters:**
  - Take control of Marcus and head toward Blume HQ. Enter through the front doors and navigate through the lobby filled with civilians and heavily armed guards.
  - Use distractions or stealth takedowns to eliminate guards quietly. Alternatively, go loud if you prefer combat.
- **Hack Access Keys:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode to locate guards carrying Access Keys or hackable devices with the keys. Retrieve them to unlock doors protecting your objectives.
- **Reach the Hidden Staircase:**
  - After unlocking both objectives on this floor, find a hidden staircase beneath a fountain in the center of the room. Descend into Blume’s basement.

#### **5. Hack into Blume’s Core Servers**
- **Locate Red Boxes:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode to find red boxes that unlock doors leading deeper into Blume’s facility.
  - Interact with these boxes to progress through locked areas.
- **Download Data:**
  - Once inside the core server room, interact with a terminal to download incriminating evidence against Dušan Nemec and Blume.

#### **6. Escape Blume Headquarters**
- After completing your hack:
  - Guards will begin filtering into the basement. You’ll need to fight or sneak your way out:
    - *Option 1: Combat:* Use powerful weapons or environmental hacks (e.g., exploding objects) to clear guards quickly.
    - *Option 2: Stealth:* Wait for guards to spread out and take them down one by one using melee attacks or distractions.
    - *Option 3: Mass Comms Disruptor:* Use this ability frequently to disable enemy communications and create opportunities for escape.
  - Make your way back up the stairs you used earlier.

- On the first floor:
  - Another wave of guards will appear. Use similar tactics as before (combat, stealth, or disruption) to reach the building’s exit.
  
- Once outside:
  - A cutscene will play showing Marcus escaping safely.

#### **7. Final Confrontation with Dušan Nemec**
- After escaping Blume HQ:
  - DedSec uploads all incriminating data about Dušan Nemec onto social media platforms.
  - A cutscene will show Dušan being arrested for his crimes as DedSec celebrates their victory over Blume.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Character Strengths:**
   - Sitara focuses on puzzles; plan your moves carefully during her section as she lacks drones or heavy weapons.
   - Wrench excels in combat; use his explosives liberally during his section for maximum destruction.
   - Marcus is versatile; use stealth or combat based on your preferred playstyle during his infiltration.

2. **Upgrade Skills:**
   - Abilities like *Mass Comms Disruptor* (to disable guard communications) and *Environmental Manipulation* (to create distractions) are invaluable during this mission.

3. **Plan Your Escape Routes:**
   - Before engaging enemies or objectives, scout for exits using *NetHack* mode or drones.

4. **Manage Time During Puzzles:**
   - Sitara’s puzzle has a time limit; focus on visibility by moving quickly between nodes.

5. **Use Distractions Effectively:**
   - Hacking phones or triggering environmental traps can give you an edge when dealing with large groups of guards.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain massive followers for DedSec by exposing Dušan Nemec and dismantling ctOS globally.
2. Complete the Main Operations storyline of *Watch Dogs 2*.
3. Unlock post-game content such as side missions and free roam activities.
4. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for any remaining skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
