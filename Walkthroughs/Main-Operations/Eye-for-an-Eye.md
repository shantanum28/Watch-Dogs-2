### **Mission Walkthrough: Eye for an Eye**

The **Eye for an Eye** mission in *Watch Dogs 2* is a Main Operation where DedSec seeks revenge after one of their own is targeted by Blume’s operatives. Marcus must investigate the attack, uncover the culprits, and retaliate against Blume to protect DedSec.

#### **Objective**
Investigate the attack on a DedSec member, track down Blume’s operatives, and retaliate by exposing their illegal activities.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team learns that one of their members has been targeted by Blume’s operatives, and they suspect this is part of a larger operation to take down DedSec.
- Marcus decides to investigate and strike back at Blume.

#### **2. Investigate the Attack**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the location where the attack occurred.
- Once you arrive, use *NetHack* mode to scan the area for clues:
  - Look for hackable devices like phones, security cameras, or laptops that contain information about the attackers.
  - Download data from these devices to piece together what happened.

#### **3. Travel to Blume’s Operative Hideout**
- After gathering evidence, follow your waypoint to a hideout where Blume operatives are stationed.
- The hideout is a restricted area with guards patrolling.

#### **4. Scout the Hideout**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects in the area.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **5. Infiltrate the Hideout**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **6. Hack into Blume’s Systems**
- Your objective is to hack into a terminal inside the hideout.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to download data about Blume’s operation against DedSec.

#### **7. Confront Blume Operatives**
- After completing the hack, follow your waypoint deeper into the hideout where Blume operatives are stationed.
- Expect tighter security in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.

- Inside their operations room:
  - Interact with another terminal to retrieve sensitive data about their plans against DedSec.
  - A cutscene will play where Marcus warns them that DedSec will retaliate if they continue their attacks.

#### **8. Retaliate Against Blume**
- With evidence in hand, Marcus decides to strike back at Blume by targeting one of their key facilities.
- Follow your waypoint to a Blume data center located outside San Francisco. This facility is heavily guarded and requires careful planning.

#### **9. Infiltrate the Data Center**
- **Scout Thoroughly:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or drones to mark guards and locate objectives inside the data center.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in their security systems, such as hackable cameras or junction boxes that can disable alarms.

- **Enter the Facility:**  
  - Approach from an unguarded side entrance or climb over fences using environmental objects like crates or forklifts.
  - Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering alarms to create openings.

#### **10. Hack into Blume’s Servers**
- Your objective is located inside a locked server room:
  - Use NetHack mode to trace red lines leading to junction boxes that control access. Hack these boxes remotely or physically interact with them if necessary.
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes until all connections are active.
  
- Once inside, interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about Blume’s illegal activities and sabotage their systems.

#### **11. Escape the Data Center**
- After completing the hack, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth tactics or combat skills based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a faster escape.

#### **12. Expose Blume**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Blume onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Blume’s unethical practices and warning them against targeting their members again.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Blume’s unethical practices and defending its members.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
