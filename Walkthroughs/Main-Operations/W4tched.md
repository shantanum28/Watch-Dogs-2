### **Mission Walkthrough: W4tched**

The **W4tched** mission is a Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec discovers that Blume is using ctOS to spy on citizens and manipulate their lives. Marcus must uncover the details of this program, disrupt its operations, and expose Blume’s unethical surveillance practices.

#### **Objective**
Investigate and disrupt Blume’s illegal surveillance program by hacking into their systems and exposing the data they’ve collected on unsuspecting citizens.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team learns about Blume’s new surveillance program, which uses ctOS to spy on private citizens and manipulate their digital lives.
- DedSec decides to investigate and put an end to this program.

#### **2. Travel to the Surveillance Hub**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to a ctOS surveillance hub in San Francisco.
- Once you arrive, you’ll notice that the area is a restricted zone with guards patrolling.

#### **3. Scout the Area**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects in the area.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **4. Infiltrate the Surveillance Hub**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **5. Hack into Blume’s Systems**
- Your objective is to hack into a terminal inside the surveillance hub.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **6. Investigate Blume’s Spy Program**
- After completing the first hack, follow your waypoint to another location where more information about Blume’s spy program is stored.
- Expect tighter security in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.

#### **7. Hack into Blume’s Data Servers**
- Inside the facility:
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes in NetHack mode until all connections are active.
  - Interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about Blume’s surveillance program.

#### **8. Escape the Facility**
- With all objectives completed, you’ll need to leave the facility:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels or exploding pipes) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side doors or climb out of windows for a quick escape.

#### **9. Expose Blume**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Blume onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Blume’s unethical surveillance practices and gaining significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Blume’s unethical practices.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
