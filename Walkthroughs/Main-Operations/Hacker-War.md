### **Mission Walkthrough: Hacker War**

The **Hacker War** mission is a pivotal Main Operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec faces off against Prime_Eight, a rival hacker group. This mission involves infiltrating Prime_Eight's hideout, disrupting their operations, and asserting DedSec's dominance in the hacking world.

#### **Objective**
Take down Prime_Eight by hacking their systems, disrupting their operations, and exposing their leader, Lenni.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet DedSec at the Hackerspace**
- **Starting Point:** Head to the DedSec hackerspace to trigger a cutscene. The team discusses Prime_Eight’s aggressive tactics and their attempts to undermine DedSec’s reputation.
- Marcus decides to confront Lenni, the leader of Prime_Eight, and expose her group’s activities.

#### **2. Travel to Prime_Eight’s Hideout**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to Prime_Eight’s hideout. It is located in a restricted area with several guards patrolling.
- Once you arrive, scout the area before proceeding.

#### **3. Scout the Hideout**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects in the area.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **4. Infiltrate Prime_Eight’s Hideout**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **5. Hack into Prime_Eight’s Systems**
- Your first objective is to hack into a terminal inside the hideout.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **6. Confront Lenni**
- After completing the first hack, follow your waypoint deeper into the hideout where Lenni is located.
- Expect tighter security in this area:
  - Use stealth tactics like crouching behind cover and taking out guards silently with melee attacks or your stun gun.
  - Alternatively, deploy your Jumper drone to access tight spaces and hack terminals remotely.

- Inside Lenni’s room:
  - A cutscene will play where Marcus confronts Lenni. She mocks DedSec but challenges Marcus to prove his hacking skills by completing a series of tasks.

#### **7. Complete Lenni’s Challenges**
- Lenni tasks Marcus with hacking into several systems across the city as part of her challenge:
  - Follow waypoints on your map to reach each location.
  - At each location, use NetHack mode or drones to locate hackable objects and complete objectives such as downloading data or disrupting systems.
  - Expect resistance from Prime_Eight members who will try to stop you during these tasks.

#### **8. Hack Prime_Eight’s Server Farm**
- After completing Lenni’s challenges, follow your waypoint to Prime_Eight’s server farm where their main operations are located.
- This facility is heavily guarded and requires careful planning.

- **Scout Thoroughly:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or drones to mark guards and locate objectives inside the server farm.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in their security systems, such as hackable cameras or junction boxes that can disable alarms.

- **Enter the Facility:**  
  - Approach from an unguarded side entrance or climb over fences using environmental objects like crates or forklifts.
  - Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering alarms to create openings.

#### **9. Hack into Prime_Eight’s Servers**
- Your objective is located inside a locked server room:
  - Use NetHack mode to trace red lines leading to junction boxes that control access. Hack these boxes remotely or physically interact with them if necessary.
  - Solve a hacking puzzle by rotating energy nodes until all connections are active.
  
- Once inside, interact with a computer terminal to retrieve sensitive data about Prime_Eight’s illegal activities.

#### **10. Escape the Server Farm**
- After completing the hack, guards will be on high alert:
  - Use stealth tactics or combat skills based on your playstyle.
  - Hack objects like doors, barriers, or vehicles in your path to create distractions or block pursuers.
  - Exit through side gates or climb over fences for a faster escape.

#### **11. Expose Prime_Eight**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Prime_Eight onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Prime_Eight’s illegal activities and asserting their dominance in the hacking world.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.
4. **Plan Escape Routes:** Before starting hacks, identify nearby exits in case you’re detected during your escape.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Prime_Eight’s illegal activities.
- Unlock new Main Operations as you progress through DedSec’s campaign against Blume and ctOS.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
