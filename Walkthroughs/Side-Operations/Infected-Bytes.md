### **Mission Walkthrough: Infected Bytes**

The **Infected Bytes** mission is a side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where Marcus investigates the spread of a mysterious Zombi2 virus infecting phones across the city. This mission involves tracking down infected phones, tracing the virus's origin, and uncovering the truth behind its spread.

#### **Objective**
Hack into three infected phones to trace the Zombi2 virus back to its source and uncover who is behind its proliferation.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- To start the mission, head to an **Operation Intel marker** on your map.
- Hack a phone at this location. Doing so will infect Marcus’s phone with the Zombi2 virus, triggering the mission.

#### **2. Phone Tag: Hack Three Infected Phones**
Your goal is to locate and hack three phones infected with the Zombi2 virus. Each phone is located in a different part of the city.

##### **Phone 1: First Location**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the first infected phone.
- **Use Your Drone:**
  - Deploy your Jumper or Quadcopter drone to avoid entering restricted areas.
  - Locate the phone on a high point or within a guarded area and hack it remotely.

##### **Phone 2: Second Location**
- Travel to the next marker on your map.
- The phone may be located in a more challenging area:
  - Use *NetHack* mode to locate guards and hackable objects.
  - Distract guards or use stealth tactics if you need to enter restricted zones.
  - Once you’ve found the phone, hack it using your drone or directly as Marcus.

##### **Phone 3: Third Location**
- Head to the final marker for the third infected phone.
- Similar to previous locations, use your drone or stealth tactics to access and hack the phone.
- After hacking all three phones, Marcus will trace the virus signal back to its source.

#### **3. Device Zero: Investigate HaDoCk’s Hideout**
The source of the virus is revealed to be tied to HaDoCk, a legendary hacker in *Watch Dogs 2*. The signal leads you to a gang-controlled area.

- **Travel to Gang Territory:**
  - Follow your waypoint to a gang hideout where HaDoCk’s signal originates.
  
- **Scout the Area:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode or drones to mark guards and locate your objective—a phone tied to HaDoCk’s operations.
  
- **Hack Remotely:**
  - You don’t need to physically enter this area. Deploy your Quadcopter drone and fly it toward the phone. Hack it remotely without engaging any enemies.

#### **4. Discover HaDoCk’s Plan**
- After hacking the phone, Marcus learns that HaDoCk isn’t working with gangs but has been using a homeless man as an unwitting courier for spreading the Zombi2 virus.
- The mission ends here for now, leaving DedSec wondering about HaDoCk’s true motives.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Jumper and Quadcopter drones are invaluable for hacking phones remotely, especially in guarded areas.
   
2. **Tag Enemies Early:**
   - Use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones to mark guards and identify hackable objects like cameras or traps.

3. **Avoid Combat:**
   - This mission emphasizes stealth and hacking over combat. Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms) if needed.

4. **Plan Your Route:**
   - Scout each area thoroughly before attempting hacks. Identify alternative paths if direct access is blocked by guards.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain **27,000 followers** for DedSec by completing this operation.
2. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Infected Bytes" mission highlights *Watch Dogs 2*’s creative use of hacking mechanics while introducing players to HaDoCk, one of the game’s most enigmatic characters!
