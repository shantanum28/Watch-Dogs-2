### **Mission Walkthrough: Rodentia Academy**

The **Rodentia Academy** mission is a side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* that involves tracking down and destroying rat-themed masks used by a group of suspicious individuals. This quirky mission combines stealth, hacking, and exploration as you uncover DedSec’s latest target.

#### **Objective**
Hack into the phones of three individuals wearing rat masks, locate their hideout, and destroy their gear to disrupt their activities.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- The **Rodentia Academy** mission becomes available after progressing through the main story and completing certain side operations.
- Open the DedSec App on Marcus’s phone to track the mission.

#### **2. Travel to the First Location**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to the northeast side of the SFMOMA building in San Francisco.
- Use *NetHack* mode to locate three individuals wearing rat masks.

#### **3. Hack the Phones of Rat-Masked Individuals**
- **Find and Hack Targets:**
  - Two of the individuals are in public spaces, making them easy to approach and hack without drawing attention.
  - The third individual is inside a restricted area:
    - Use your Jumper drone to scout the area and tag enemies.
    - Distract guards or use stealth to avoid detection while hacking their phone.
- Once all three phones are hacked, you’ll receive information about their hideout.

#### **4. Travel to the Garage (Rat Hideout)**
- Follow your waypoint to a garage in a restricted area where the rat-masked group stores their gear.
- Use *NetHack* mode or drones to scout the area:
  - Tag guards and locate cameras or hackable objects.
  - Identify any access keys needed to unlock doors.

#### **5. Infiltrate the Garage**
- **Choose Your Approach:**
  - *Stealth:* Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms) to sneak past enemies.
  - *Aggressive:* Use non-lethal weapons like the stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Access the Garage:**
  - Once inside, locate a ctOS box or terminal that unlocks access to the main storage area.

#### **6. Destroy Rat Masks and Gear**
- Inside the garage, you’ll find a collection of rat masks and other gear used by this group.
- Interact with the gear to destroy it:
  - You may need to use explosives (crafted or environmental) or interact with specific objects marked on your HUD.
- Be prepared for reinforcements as destroying the gear may alert nearby enemies.

#### **7. Escape the Area**
- After destroying all gear, leave the restricted area:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection if you’re still in stealth mode.
  - If reinforcements arrive, use environmental hacks (e.g., exploding objects or barriers) to slow them down as you make your escape.

#### **8. Mission Complete**
- Once you’ve successfully escaped, DedSec will upload footage of the operation online, completing your objective.
- A cutscene may play showing DedSec gaining followers as they expose this group’s suspicious activities.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Jumper drone is ideal for scouting restricted areas and hacking terminals remotely without putting Marcus at risk.
   - The Quadcopter is useful for marking enemies and locating objectives from above.

2. **Tag Enemies Early:**
   - Use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones to track guard movements and identify hackable objects like cameras or traps.

3. **Plan Your Escape Routes:**
   - Before engaging with objectives, identify exits in case reinforcements arrive during your escape.

4. **Upgrade Skills:**
   - Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Enhanced Botnet* (to improve hacking efficiency) can make this mission easier.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain followers for DedSec by exposing and disrupting this suspicious group’s activities.
2. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.
