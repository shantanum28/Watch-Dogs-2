### **Mission Walkthrough: Pink Slips**

The **Pink Slips** side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* involves uncovering unethical practices by the Pharmingtons company, which is firing employees based on their connections to DedSec. Marcus and the team decide to hack into Pharmingtons’ systems to expose their actions and help affected employees.

#### **Objective**
Hack into Pharmingtons’ systems, retrieve evidence of their unethical practices, and provide financial compensation to fired employees.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- The **Pink Slips** mission can be unlocked by interacting with an **Operation Intel marker** on the map.
- Hack a phone at the marker to learn that Pharmingtons is firing employees flagged for searching DedSec online. This triggers the mission.

#### **2. Black Sheep: Hack the ctOS Box**
- **Travel to the Marked Location:** Follow your waypoint to a building owned by Pharmingtons.
- **Locate the ctOS Box:**
  - The box is locked and requires solving a network bypass puzzle.
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to highlight nodes and connections.

##### **Solve the Node Puzzle:**
1. Find the three-pronged node near the ctOS box and rotate it to enable all three lines.
2. Follow one line down the side of the building to a corner node. Rotate this node to complete the flow.
3. Swing around to the right side of the building and unlock another node.
4. Rotate this corner node to direct energy up the wall toward the ctOS box.

- Once all nodes are aligned, unlock and hack into the ctOS box.
- **Hack Cameras Inside:**
  - After gaining access, hack into cameras inside Pharmingtons’ office.
  - Locate a laptop on a desk and hack it to read an email revealing that employees are flagged for searching DedSec online.

#### **3. Pro Bono: Hack Pharmingtons’ Finance System**
- **Travel to the Next Location:** Follow your waypoint to another Pharmingtons facility.
- **Infiltrate the Garage:**
  - The ctOS box is located inside a locked garage guarded by security personnel.
  - Use your Jumper drone:
    1. Deploy it outside the garage and navigate through vents or small openings.
    2. Hack a Blume panel inside to gain access keys for locked doors.

- **Open the Garage Door:**
  - Use your Jumper drone or Marcus to open the large garage door remotely.
  - Enter the garage and locate another ctOS box.

##### **Hack Inside Pharmingtons’ Office:**
1. Hack into cameras inside the office after accessing the ctOS box.
2. Locate a laptop on a desk and hack it remotely using cameras.
3. Hack a tablet near the laptop to finalize your access.

- Once hacked, DedSec transfers $10,000 bonuses from Pharmingtons’ accounts to all employees who were unfairly fired due to their search history.

#### **4. Mission Complete**
- After completing both objectives, Marcus informs DedSec that they’ve successfully exposed Pharmingtons’ unethical practices and helped affected employees.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec gaining public support as news of their actions spreads.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Jumper drone is particularly useful for navigating tight spaces like vents or hacking terminals remotely without alerting guards.
   - The Quadcopter can help scout areas from above and tag guards or hackable objects.

2. **Tag Enemies Early:**
   - Use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones to mark guards and locate hackable objects like cameras or panels.

3. **Plan Your Approach:**
   - Use stealth tactics like distractions or environmental hacks (e.g., triggering alarms) to avoid detection while infiltrating guarded areas.

4. **Solve Puzzles Methodically:**
   - For network bypass puzzles, focus on one line at a time and ensure energy flows smoothly through all nodes before moving on.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain approximately **27,000 followers** for DedSec by completing this operation.
2. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Pink Slips" mission is an engaging side operation that highlights *Watch Dogs 2*’s blend of stealth, hacking puzzles, and social justice themes as DedSec takes down another unethical corporation!
