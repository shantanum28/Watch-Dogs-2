### **Mission Walkthrough: Ghost Signals**

The **Ghost Signals** mission is a side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where Marcus investigates a mysterious 52-Hertz signal, often referred to as the "loneliest whale" frequency. This mission involves solving puzzles, hacking antennas, and uncovering the source of the enigmatic signal. It’s a mix of exploration and challenging network bypass puzzles.

#### **Objective**
Trace the 52-Hertz signal back to its source by solving puzzles, hacking antennas, and uncovering its origin.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- To start the mission, head to an **Operation Intel marker** on your map.
- Hack a satellite dish at this location to pick up the mysterious 52-Hertz signal. This will unlock the side operation **Ghost Signals**.

#### **2. Follow the Signal to Fort Point**
- Follow the waypoint to Fort Point, located near the Golden Gate Bridge.
- Enter the building and locate a hackable door on the west side of the facility. There are no guards in this area, so you can explore freely.
- Hack into the server inside the room to continue.

#### **3. Solve the 52-Hertz Puzzle**
- After hacking the server, Marcus will be locked inside the room, triggering a network bypass puzzle.
- **How to Solve the Puzzle:**
  - The puzzle involves routing energy flows through nodes to unlock the door.
  - Start by identifying the source of the flow (the server you hacked).
  - Work your way through each node by rotating them to connect pathways.
  - Follow these steps:
    - Rotate nodes near the server to direct energy toward adjacent nodes.
    - Unlock new nodes as you progress and ensure all paths are connected correctly.
    - Use *NetHack* mode to visualize connections and track progress.
  - Once all nodes are aligned correctly, you’ll unlock the door and be able to leave.

#### **4. Whiteout: Hack Antennas Along the Bridge**
- After escaping Fort Point, Marcus determines that additional antennas along the Golden Gate Bridge are broadcasting parts of the signal.
- **First Antenna:**
  - Activate *NetHack* mode and look above Fort Point to spot an antenna.
  - Deploy your Quadcopter drone and fly up to hack it remotely.

- **Second Antenna:**
  - The next antenna is located further south along the bridge. Move closer and deploy your drone again to hack it.

- **Third Antenna:**
  - Continue following waypoints along the bridge until you reach another antenna. Repeat the process using your drone.

#### **5. Final Destination: Cemetery**
- The final signal leads Marcus to a cemetery south of San Francisco.
- Follow your waypoint to this location and look for a ctOS box near a tombstone.
- Hack into this box and activate *NetHack* mode to locate a nearby camera.
- Use this camera to find another server hidden in the cemetery and hack it remotely.

#### **6. Discovering the Truth**
- After completing all hacks, Marcus uncovers that the signal was part of a recruitment tool tied to an intelligence agency (possibly referencing organizations like NSA).
- A cutscene will play where Marcus explains how DedSec erased all traces of their involvement while exposing any remaining data tied to this mysterious operation.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Quadcopter is essential for hacking antennas located in hard-to-reach places like high points on bridges or rooftops.

2. **Take Your Time with Puzzles:**
   - The network bypass puzzle at Fort Point can be tricky. Work methodically by focusing on one section at a time and ensuring energy flows smoothly through all nodes.

3. **Use NetHack Mode Frequently:**
   - NetHack mode helps visualize connections between nodes during puzzles and highlights hackable objects like antennas or ctOS boxes.

4. **Plan Drone Battery Usage:**
   - Make sure your Quadcopter has enough battery life for extended flights when hacking multiple antennas along the Golden Gate Bridge.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain approximately **18,000 followers** for DedSec by completing this operation.
2. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Ghost Signals" mission is one of *Watch Dogs 2*’s most intriguing side operations, blending cryptic puzzles with exploration as you uncover a mysterious signal tied to secretive organizations!
