### **Mission Walkthrough: Haum Intruder**

The **Haum Intruder** mission is a *Watch Dogs 2* Side Operation where DedSec takes on Haum, a smart home company suspected of spying on its customers through their devices. Marcus must infiltrate Haum’s systems, retrieve incriminating data, and expose their unethical practices.

#### **Objective**
Hack into Haum’s systems, retrieve evidence of their invasive surveillance practices, and expose their illegal activities to the public.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- The **Haum Intruder** mission becomes available after completing the Main Operation **Haum Sweet Haum**.
- Open the DedSec App on Marcus’s phone to track the mission.

#### **2. Travel to the Haum Facility**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to a Haum facility in San Francisco.
- The building is located in a restricted area with guards patrolling.

#### **3. Scout the Area**
- **Use NetHack Mode:**  
  - Activate *NetHack* mode to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects in the area.
  - Identify key objectives like locked doors, access keys, and terminals.

- **Deploy Your Jumper or Quadcopter (Optional):**  
  - Use your Jumper drone to scout tight spaces or hack terminals remotely.
  - The Quadcopter is useful for marking guards and surveying the area from above.

#### **4. Infiltrate the Facility**
- **Choose Your Approach:**  
  - Stealth: Use distractions like hacking guards’ phones or triggering environmental objects (e.g., alarms or machinery) to sneak past enemies.
  - Aggressive: Use your stun gun or melee attacks to neutralize guards silently.

- **Find an Entry Point:**  
  - Look for side entrances or climbable structures like scaffolding or crates to bypass heavily guarded areas.
  - Alternatively, use hacked forklifts or other machinery to create pathways.

#### **5. Hack into Haum’s Systems**
- Your objective is to hack into a terminal inside the facility.
- **Locate an Access Key:**  
  - Use NetHack mode or cameras to find an access key held by a guard or stored on a nearby laptop. Hack it remotely to unlock doors.
- Once you have access, interact with the terminal to initiate a data download.

#### **6. Escape the Facility**
- With the hack complete, you’ll need to leave the building:
  - Retrace your steps while avoiding detection.
  - If spotted, use environmental hacks (e.g., triggering electrical panels or exploding pipes) to slow down pursuers.
  - Exit through side doors or climb out of windows for a quick escape.

#### **7. Expose Haum**
- With all evidence collected, follow your waypoint back to DedSec HQ or another public location where Marcus uploads incriminating data about Haum onto social media platforms.
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec exposing Haum’s invasive surveillance practices and gaining significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Use Your Tools Effectively:** The Jumper drone is particularly useful for accessing terminals in restricted areas without risking detection.
2. **Tag Enemies Early:** Always use NetHack mode or cameras before entering restricted zones so you can track guard movements.
3. **Upgrade Skills:** Abilities like *Environmental Manipulation* (to trigger distractions) and *Stealth Sprint* (to move quickly while crouched) are helpful for this mission.

### **Rewards**
- Gain followers for DedSec by exposing Haum’s unethical practices.
- Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "Haum Intruder" mission is a great opportunity to practice stealth and hacking skills while taking on one of *Watch Dogs 2*’s most prominent corporate villains!
