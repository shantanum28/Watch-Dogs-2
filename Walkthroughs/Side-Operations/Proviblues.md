### **Mission Walkthrough: ProviBlues**

The **ProviBlues** mission is a side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where DedSec uncovers and disrupts the unethical practices of ProviBlue, an insurance company exploiting its customers through unfair "risk clauses." This mission involves hacking, stealth, and creative problem-solving to expose the company’s corruption.

#### **Objective**
Expose ProviBlue’s unethical practices by hacking their systems, gathering evidence, and targeting their executives.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- To start the mission, head to the **Operation Intel marker** on your map.
- Speak to a man who has been mistreated by ProviBlue. He explains how the company has been unfairly raising insurance rates using a "risk clause."
- DedSec decides to investigate further.

#### **2. Word Up: Hack ProviBlue Employees**
- **Travel to the First Employee’s Location:** Follow the waypoint to find a ProviBlue employee.
- **Hack Their Phone:** 
  - The first employee has just been fired, so their password is no longer valid. Sitara will redirect you to another employee.
  
- **Travel to the Second Employee’s Location:**
  - Follow the new waypoint to another ProviBlue employee.
  - Hack their phone successfully this time to gain access to ProviBlue’s internal systems.

#### **3. Risk Clause: Infiltrate ProviBlue Headquarters**
- **Travel to the ProviBlue Building:** Head to their headquarters in San Francisco.
  
- **Scout the Area:**
  - Use *NetHack* mode or deploy your Jumper drone to mark guards, cameras, and hackable objects.
  - Identify a ctOS panel that you’ll need to physically hack.

- **Enter Through the Alley:**
  - Approach from the west side of the building where there’s an alley.
  - Hack into nearby cameras and take control of a forklift. Use it to create a distraction, causing guards to shut down ctOS temporarily.

- **Use Your Jumper Drone:**
  - Deploy your Jumper drone and send it through a hole in the wall on the right side of the alley.
  - Navigate through tight spaces and climb stairs until you reach the ctOS box.
  - Hack into the box to gain access to the apartment of ProviBlue’s VP.

#### **4. Hack the VP’s Laptop**
- Once inside the VP’s apartment:
  - Hack into their laptop and install a virus.
  - This will allow DedSec to rewrite ProviBlue’s algorithms, exposing their unethical practices.

#### **5. Payback: Target ProviBlue Executives**
- After exposing their system, Marcus decides to go after ProviBlue’s CFO and CEO directly.

##### **Hack the Limo Routes:**
- Travel to a parking lot where you’ll find a locked device containing GPS routes for limos used by ProviBlue executives.
- Use your Jumper drone:
  - Send it through a hole in the fence on the left side of the parking lot.
  - Navigate through vents or grates until you reach a Blume panel inside. Hack it to unlock access to GPS data.

##### **Follow the CFO:**
- Use your map marker to locate the CFO’s limo route.
- Stay within range of their vehicle while driving or hack environmental objects (e.g., steam pipes) to incapacitate them temporarily.
- Download data from their phone while staying close enough for signal strength.

##### **Hack the CEO’s Phone:**
- Repeat similar steps for the CEO:
  - Locate their limo route and stay within range while downloading data from their phone.

#### **6. Leave the Area**
- After successfully hacking both executives’ phones, leave the area without being detected or pursued.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Jumper drone is crucial for accessing tight spaces like vents and hacking panels remotely without putting Marcus at risk.

2. **Tag Enemies Early:**
   - Use *NetHack* mode before entering restricted zones to mark guards and identify hackable objects like cameras or forklifts.

3. **Plan Your Escape Routes:**
   - Before engaging with objectives, scout for exits in case reinforcements are called during your escape.

4. **Stay Close During Limo Hacks:**
   - Maintain proximity while hacking GPS routes or phones. Use shortcuts or environmental hacks like traffic lights or barriers if needed.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain approximately **27,000 followers** for DedSec by completing this operation.
2. Earn experience points (XP) that can be used for skill upgrades in Marcus’s Research App.

The "ProviBlues" mission is an engaging side operation that highlights *Watch Dogs 2*’s mix of stealth, hacking puzzles, and social justice themes as DedSec takes down corrupt corporations!
