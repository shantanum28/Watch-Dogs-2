### **Mission Walkthrough: Paint Job**

The **Paint Job** mission is a side operation in *Watch Dogs 2* where Marcus helps Sitara spread DedSec’s message by tagging graffiti on high points around San Francisco. This mission involves climbing, solving environmental puzzles, and using drones or lifts to reach difficult locations.

#### **Objective**
Tag multiple graffiti locations across the city to promote DedSec and gain followers.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Meet Sitara at Pier 39**
- **Starting Point:** Begin the mission by heading to the rooftop near Pier 39 to meet Sitara.
  - There is no direct roof access, so you’ll need to use a **scissor lift** located in the parking lot to the east of the building.
  - Hack the lift, move it next to the building, and ride it to the top.
- After speaking with Sitara, she will assign you the task of tagging graffiti at various high points around the city.

#### **2. First Set of Graffiti Locations**
You’ll need to tag three graffiti locations in this set. Each location requires creative problem-solving to reach.

##### **Graffiti 1: Billboard Wall Near Pier 39**
- **Location:** South of Pier 39.
- Use a nearby **scissor lift** to reach the rooftop where the billboard is located.
- Once on the roof, climb up scaffolding or ledges to access the graffiti spot. Tag it to complete this location.

##### **Graffiti 2: Building South-East of Nudle Store**
- **Location:** Silicon Valley.
- Look for a construction lift near the building. Hack it and ride it up to a lower roof.
- From there, climb up scaffolding or use your Jumper drone to unlock any security terminals blocking access.
- Once you’ve cleared obstacles, tag the graffiti location.

##### **Graffiti 3: Billboard South-West of Nudle Store**
- **Location:** Another rooftop in Silicon Valley.
- Use a yellow ladder to climb onto a higher level. Deploy your Jumper drone through a small hole in a gate to hack a terminal that unlocks access.
- Switch back to Marcus, climb up, and tag the billboard.

#### **3. Second Set of Graffiti Locations**
This set consists of five graffiti spots across Silicon Valley and Oakland.

##### **Graffiti 1: Billboard Near Palo Alto**
- Use a parked car or scaffolding to reach higher levels of the building.
- Deploy your Jumper drone into vent shafts or small openings to disable security systems blocking access.
- Use a lift or climb up manually to reach the graffiti spot.

##### **Graffiti 2: Billboard Near Lombard Street**
- Locate a crane with a man basket attached. Hack it remotely and bring it down.
- Enter the basket with Marcus, then ride it up and position yourself near the billboard for tagging.

##### **Graffiti 3: Skyscraper Near Haum Data Center**
- Use your quadcopter drone to locate lifts on higher levels of the skyscraper. Hack them remotely and bring them down for Marcus to use.
- Ride the lift up and tag the graffiti spot on one of the walls.

##### **Graffiti 4: Tower Near Oakland Superior Court**
- Find a lift near this tower and use it to reach an upper roof.
- Climb scaffolding and ladders until you reach another lift above Marcus’s position. Hack it remotely, ride it up, and tag this graffiti spot.

##### **Graffiti 5: Building Near Oakland Arena**
- Start in an alley near this building. Climb ladders and use your Jumper drone to unlock gates blocking access.
- Once inside, climb more ladders and jump across rooftops until you reach the graffiti location.

#### **4. Third Set of Graffiti Locations**
This set consists of four graffiti spots in Oakland and San Francisco.

##### **Graffiti 1: Parking Garage in Central Oakland**
- Start at street level near an underground parking entrance.
- Use your Jumper drone to hack terminals inside guarded areas without being detected. Once gates are unlocked, climb staircases or take side paths up to the roof for tagging.

##### **Graffiti 2: Building Near Pacific Renaissance Plaza**
- Hack into a crane nearby and bring its cage down. Enter it with Marcus, then ride it up onto a rooftop where you can tag this location.

##### **Graffiti 3: Building South of Ghirardelli Square**
- Locate a lift near one of the blue walls on this building. Hack it, ride it up, and explore rooftops until you find another lift leading downwards toward the graffiti spot.

##### **Graffiti 4: Golden Gate Bridge (Final Set)**
This final set involves tagging four locations on San Francisco’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge:
1. Start by hacking lifts at lower levels of the bridge. Ride them up and climb ladders to reach each tagging point.
2. Continue ascending by hacking additional lifts and using ladders strategically until all four spots are tagged.

#### **5. Completion**
Once all graffiti locations are tagged:
- A cutscene will play showing DedSec’s message spreading across San Francisco as they gain significant public support.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Unlock Required Skills:**
   - Ensure you have *Environmental RC* (for controlling lifts) and *Enhanced Spring* (for Jumper drone jumps) unlocked before starting this mission.
   
2. **Use Drones Effectively:**
   - The Jumper drone is invaluable for accessing tight spaces like vent shafts or hacking terminals remotely.
   - The Quadcopter is helpful for scouting locations or hacking objects from above.

3. **Plan Your Route:**
   - Take time to scout each area using *NetHack* mode or drones before attempting climbs or hacks.

4. **Avoid Combat (When Possible):**
   - Most locations are unguarded, but some areas may have enemies patrolling. Use stealth tactics like distractions or environmental hacks if needed.

### **Rewards**

1. Gain significant followers for DedSec:
   - Completing all graffiti tags earns you approximately +66,600 followers total.
   
2. Unlock new side operations as part of DedSec’s campaign against Blume.

The "Paint Job" mission is an engaging side operation that highlights *Watch Dogs 2*’s environmental puzzles while promoting DedSec’s rebellious spirit through creative graffiti!
