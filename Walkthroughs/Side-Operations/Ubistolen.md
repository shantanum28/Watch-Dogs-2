### **Mission Walkthrough: Ubistolen**

The **Ubistolen** mission is a fun and self-referential *Watch Dogs 2* side operation where DedSec hacks into Ubisoft’s San Francisco office to leak an unreleased game trailer. This mission is a lighthearted Easter egg that pokes fun at Ubisoft itself and rewards players with followers for completing it.

#### **Objective**
Hack into Ubisoft’s office, retrieve the unreleased game trailer, and leak it to the public to gain followers.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **1. Unlock the Mission**
- You can access the **Ubistolen** mission by hacking one of the Operation Intel points scattered around the map. Once unlocked, it will appear in your DedSec App under Side Operations.

#### **2. Travel to Ubisoft Headquarters**
- Open your map and follow the waypoint to Ubisoft’s San Francisco office.
- The building is located in a restricted area, but there are no guards, making this mission more about exploration and hacking than combat.

#### **3. Find a Way to the Roof**
- **Locate the Graffitied Semi-Trailer:**  
  - Head around the back of the Ubisoft building to find a semi-trailer with graffiti on it.  
  - Climb onto the trailer, then look for a path leading up to the roof.

- **Climb Higher:**  
  - Once on the roof, turn right and continue climbing using ledges and platforms until you reach the top of the building.

#### **4. Hack the ctOS Box**
- On the roof, locate a ctOS box. Interact with it to gain access to Ubisoft’s internal camera system.
- This will allow you to hack into various cameras inside the building.

#### **5. Navigate Through Cameras**
- Use a series of camera hacks to locate and access Ubisoft’s internal systems:
  1. Start by hacking the camera mounted on the same wall as the ctOS box.
  2. Turn right to find another camera inside the building. Hack into it.
  3. Continue switching between cameras until you locate a laptop on a desk.

#### **6. Download the Trailer**
- Hack into the laptop on the desk to download an unreleased game trailer from Ubisoft’s servers.
- The trailer will automatically be distributed by DedSec after download, completing your objective.

#### **7. Mission Complete**
- After downloading and leaking the trailer, a cutscene will play showing DedSec gaining followers as excitement builds over the leaked game footage.

### **Tips for Success**
1. **Scout Thoroughly:** While there are no enemies in this mission, use NetHack mode to easily identify hackable objects like cameras and laptops.
2. **Use Drones if Needed:** If you’re having trouble finding paths or objects, deploy your Jumper or Quadcopter drones for better visibility.
3. **Enjoy the Easter Egg:** This mission is meant to be lighthearted and fun, so take your time exploring Ubisoft’s virtual office!
